/**
 * An experiment is sent to a newly discovered moon of one of the major solar system planets to determine the acceleration due to gravity (g) on the surface of this moon.
 * You are presented with the experimental data in two lists: pendulum lengths (in meters) and oscillation times (in seconds). Your job is to determine the mean value of the g.
 * The relevant formula that you need is:
 * g = l (2Ï€/T)**2
 * where l is the length and T is the time (see the dataset below).
 * You must use the map2 method that you developed in the previous question to yield the list of g-values.
 * Finally, calculate the mean of the g-values using reduce or foldLeft.
