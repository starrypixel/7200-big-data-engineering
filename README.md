CSYE7200 Bid-data engineering with Scala taught by Prof Robin Hillyard at NEU.

This course is designed to give you an introduction to the world of functional programming and its importance
in the areas of reactive programming (for concurrent systems) and Big Data. We do this by learning Scala and
Spark and, in particular, how Spark was built on top of Scala. Please note that most of the lectures concentrate
on Scala and functional programming, rather than Spark and Big Data. Above all, this is a practical class: you
will learn many aspects of programming and software engineering that are useful whatever language you are
using.

Topics include Scala, Spark, Functional programming
